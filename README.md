> Another thing to mention is that all buttons have very nice visual effects, having sound only in the on/off/reset when clicked <b>and</b>, the logo on the screen is constantly rotating to add a dinamic effect. <br>
>Feel free to use for your own purposes.

>By the way... binary code inserted in html file <b>does</b> say something...;)
